# Homewizard Charge Optimizer with Zonneplan Integration

**Homewizard Charge Optimizer** automates Homewizard battery charging based on Zonneplan's dynamic electricity tariffs.  
It fetches daily tariffs from Zonneplan, analyzes them, and schedules battery charging for the cheapest hours.  
The goal: maximize savings and efficiency by charging when electricity is cheapest (or negative).  

Run it autonomously on a Raspberry Pi for always-optimized battery charging.

**Example of a calculated charging schedule:**

This project is a .NET 9 application that integrates with Homewizard batteries and Zonneplan's API to manage battery charging intelligently.  
It is designed for C# developers who want a customizable, open-source alternative to Home Assistant.

The applications uses linear programming (https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp) to optimize battery charging schedules based on electricity prices, battery capacity, and SoC.
Every 5 minutes (configurable) it polls the Homewizard P1 meter for current consumption/production data and battery status and recalculates the optimal charging schedule.

## Features

- Automatic retrieval of Zonneplan dynamic tariffs
- Smart scheduling for Homewizard battery charging
- Support for multiple Homewizard batteries (only tested with one battery, since I only have one)
- Configurable thresholds and parameters
- Runs as a background service on for example a Raspberry Pi
- Automatic restart on reboot when configured as a service

---

## Known Limitations
- Homewizard currently does not support a discharge only mode. The battery will always charge when there is excess production when in zero mode.
  - As soon as Homewizard supports a discharge only mode, this application will be updated to support that since that will be more cost-efficient.
- The Zonneplan API has rate limits. Avoid setting the tariff refresh interval too low to prevent hitting these limits.

## Prerequisites

- Windows or Linux systems
- .NET 9 SDK and Runtime
- Homewizard battery and P1 meter
- Zonneplan account with API access

## Creating tokens for Homewizard and Zonneplan

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/fijsh/hw-charge-optimizer/wiki/Creating-Homewizard-and-Zonneplan-tokens) for information about how to create tokens for Homewizard and Zonneplan.

## Configure the Application

The `appsettings.json` file contains all configuration settings.

    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Settings Explained

    - `RefreshIntervalMinutes`: How often (in minutes) to poll the Homewizard battery and P1 meter. Recommended: 5 minutes.
    - `P1`: Homewizard P1 meter settings.
        - `Ip`: IP address of your P1 meter.
        - `Username`: Username for the P1 meter (friendly name for reference only).
        - `Token`: Authentication token for the P1 meter.
        - `BatteryMode`: Current battery mode (`zero`, `to_full`, `standby`). (auto-managed)
        - `PowerW`, `MaxConsumptionW`, `MaxProductionW`, `TargetPowerW`: Internal state. (auto-managed).
        - `MaxConsumptionW`: Max consumption in watts. retrieved from P1 meter (auto-managed).

## Troubleshooting

The application uses Serilog for logging. If you encounter issues:

- Ensure your configuration file is correct and tokens are valid.
- Verify network connectivity to Homewizard and Zonneplan endpoints.
- Make sure you don't hit Zonneplan API rate limits.
- You must create a local user/token for the P1 meter and each Homewizard battery.
